### Credits

The first iteration of HTML generation uses Handlebars templates originally authored by [Kevin Renskers' raml2html](https://github.com/kevinrenskers/raml2html/blob/master/lib/template.handlebars)
.  If it was not for this leading example, this plugin would not have gotten such a leap in development speed.
